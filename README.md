## Project Description: JavaScript Weather App with API

**This project aims to develop a dynamic and informative weather application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, leveraging an external weather API to provide real-time weather data.**

The weather app will offer users a user-friendly interface to search for weather information based on their desired location. Key features will include:

* **Real-time weather updates:** Displaying current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy), humidity, wind speed, and other relevant metrics.
* **Location search:** Allowing users to search for weather information by city or zip code.
* **Interactive elements:** Incorporating animations, transitions, and user interactions to enhance the user experience.

By utilizing a weather API, the app will access accurate and up-to-date weather data, ensuring that users have access to the most reliable information. This project will demonstrate my proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and API integration, as well as my ability to create functional and engaging web applications.
